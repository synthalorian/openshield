# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- **Command Palette** — Fuzzy-searchable command overlay triggered by `Ctrl+P` or typing `/` in input. 16 commands with keyboard navigation (↑/↓, Enter to execute, Esc to close, Backspace to filter).
- **Session Bookmarks / Checkpoints** — Save and restore named session checkpoints. `Ctrl+Shift+B` toggles the bookmark manager. Ctrl+N to create, Enter to load, Esc to close. Persistent per-session JSON storage.
- **Inline Image Display** — Rich metadata indicators for pasted/attached images: format (PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP/BMP), dimensions, file size. ASCII art placeholder boxes rendered in chat area.
- **Streaming Markdown Renderer** — Inline markdown parsing for assistant messages: **bold**, *italic*, `code`, [links](url), ~~strikethrough~~. Applied to all non-code-block content in real-time.
- **Connection Pooling** — `reqwest` client with `pool_max_idle_per_host(10)`, TCP keepalive, 15s connect timeout, HTTP/2 support. Reduces connection overhead for repeated API calls.
- **Async Cache Persistence** — Cache `set()` now spawns disk write via `tokio::spawn`, eliminating synchronous fs blocking on the hot path.
- **Cache Key Optimization** — Eliminated double JSON serialization in `chat_stream` by reusing `build_chat_body()` output for cache keys.

### Changed

- **Compiler warnings** — 40 → 0. Systematic cleanup across all modules.
- **Test count** — 337 → 363 tests (added image_display dimension detection, format indicator, ASCII placeholder, human_size tests).

### Fixed

- **Test compilation** — Added missing `keybindings` field to all test `Config` struct initializers (config, router, self_improve modules).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- **Swarm Mode** — Multi-agent orchestration with 8 built-in roles (Architect, Implementer, Reviewer, Tester, DevOps, Security, Documentation, PM). Consensus memory, autonomous event-driven loops, real LLM integration per agent with isolated context. `openshield swarm init/start/stop/status` CLI commands.
- **Swarm Real-Time Streaming** — Per-agent chunk streaming with role-colored headers in the TUI. Agent internal monologue visible in real-time, filtered for persona-preamble noise. Broadcast channel architecture for live TUI updates.
- **Swarm Persona Filter** — Strips "I am the X agent" self-convincing preamble from agent responses. 500+ pattern coverage across all roles, applied per-chunk and to final results.
- **Swarm Inspector Sidebar** — Fourth sidebar tab (Ctrl+S) showing all active agents with status, content preview, and expandable tool results. Enter to toggle expansion. 📄 icon when code detected.
- **Swarm Staggered Starts** — Agents start with 2s delays between them to avoid provider contention. Timeout bumped to 180s for parallel agent execution.
- **24 Native Capability Tools** — Zero-external-dependency tool suite: web search, browser automation, X/Twitter search, vision, image generation, video, TTS, memory, session search, todo, cronjob, skills, messaging, Home Assistant, Spotify, Yuanbao, computer use, Mixture of Agents, delegation, clarifying questions, and Python code execution. 32 total tools.
- **Syntax Highlighting** — Full syntax highlighting for code blocks in TUI and swarm streaming. Supports Rust, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, JSON, TOML, YAML, Bash. Keywords (magenta), types (cyan), strings (green), numbers (yellow), comments (gray italic). Code blocks render with `┌─ code ─` / `└─────────` borders.
- **Context Compression** — Token-aware context compression with semantic summarization. Keeps long conversations within model context limits automatically.
- **Evolution Engine** — Self-adaptive behavior engine that tracks tool outcomes, model performance, and session quality to evolve routing weights and behavior over time.
- **Matrix Gateway** — Full sync loop scaffold with `MatrixReplySender`, homeserver validation, and unified router integration.
- **Slack Gateway** — Socket Mode scaffold with `SlackReplySender`, ready event emission, and full Socket Mode connection structure.
- **Swarm CLI** — Terminal commands for multi-agent orchestration: `init`, `start`, `stop`, `status`.
- **`openshield tools` CLI** — `openshield tools list` shows all native and capability tools with descriptions.

### Changed

- **Version bump** — 0.4.0 → 1.0.0 (production-ready release).
- **Test count** — 246 → 337 comprehensive tests across all modules.
- **Token estimation** — Switched from word-count to char/4 heuristic for more accurate context usage tracking.
- **Swarm config gate removed** — `openshield swarm init` no longer requires `enabled = true` in config. Swarm is always available.

### Fixed

- **Test compilation errors** — Added missing `context_compression` field to all test Config struct initializers.
- **TUI cursor positioning** — Word-wrap cursor position now matches Paragraph widget rendering exactly. No more drift on wrapped lines.
- **Swarm config reload** — `/swarm init` now reloads config from disk so runtime edits take effect immediately.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-30

### Added

- **Multi-model comparison overlay** — `Ctrl+V` toggles a 90%×85% popup showing primary + all secondary model responses with navigation (↑/↓), model names, latency, and token counts.
- **Multi-model response attachment** — Secondary responses attach to the primary assistant message instead of creating truncated system messages.
- **Chat area multi-model indicator** — "📊 3 alternate responses — Ctrl+V to compare" appears on assistant messages with secondary responses.
- **Multi-platform gateway reply paths** — Telegram, Slack, and Matrix gateways now send responses back to their respective platforms (was previously log-only stubs).
- **Telegram reply sender** — `TelegramReplySender` with `Bot` instance; messages chunked at Telegram's 4096 char limit.
- **Slack Socket Mode scaffold** — Real connection structure with `SlackReplySender`; emits `Ready` event; full Socket Mode TODO documented.
- **Matrix sync loop scaffold** — Real connection structure with `MatrixReplySender`; validates homeserver, user_id, access_token config; full sync loop TODO documented.
- **Unified router reply wiring** — All three platforms now pass `ReplySender` to `UnifiedRouter`, which spawns reply tasks that actually call platform APIs.

### Changed

- **Version bump** — 0.1.0 → 0.4.0 (reflecting substantial feature maturity).

### Fixed

- **Telegram responses** — No longer "fire and forget"; replies stream back to the originating chat.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-30

### Added

- **Security architecture** — 4-layer security: sandbox, identity, PII, guardrails. Wired into all 5 tool execution paths.
- **Autonomous mode toggle** — `Ctrl+A` switches between safe and full-send security modes.
- **Personalized chat names** — Configurable `user_name` and `agent.display_name` in TUI.
- **Natural language control words** — Pre-filter stop/wait/continue/cancel/go before hitting the model API.
- **3 TUI themes** — Blackshield default, Steel Blue, and High Contrast. `Ctrl+T` cycling.
- **Native MCP client** — stdio + SSE transport, JSON-RPC 2.0, tool discovery/execution.
- **Multi-platform gateway** — Discord ✅, Telegram ✅, Slack 🟡, Matrix 🟡.
- **Optional multi-model mode** — Off by default, toggleable at runtime via `/multi` or `!multi`.

### Changed

- **MAX_ITERATIONS** — 88 (was 888 in early dev).
- **Hermes runtime dependency removed** — Setup/config transfer preserved, but no runtime bridges.

### Fixed

- **128 compiler warnings** → 0. Systematic dead code cleanup.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-29
